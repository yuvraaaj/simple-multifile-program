# simple-multifile-program
A simple example C++ program to demonstrate the use of user-defined functions using multiple files in the program.

Question for the program (taken from Codeacademy's "Learn C++" course):

1.
In main.cpp, we have a program with a few functions. Letâ€™s move them into a different file.

First, add a declaration for each function in main.cpp above the functions above main().

2.
Now, move all of the function definitions over to my_functions.cpp.

3.
Finally, compile and execute your code. Remember to link the two .cpp files when compiling.
